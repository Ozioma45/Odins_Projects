# Exercise 05 - sumAll

Okay, this was very hard for me to meet up with all the test. i decided to try chat gpt with my code for the first time and the result was awesome. Though it did not give me the best at first but with some arrangement and properly words and terms, i got what i wanted. Chat gpt is really a revolution for programmer and i think everyone should try it. The only downside is that it may produce lazy programmer but still we should just use it wisely

Implement a function that takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every number between(and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4) // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```


## Hints

Think about how you would do this on pen and paper and then how you might translate that process into code:
- make sure you pay attention to the function parameters
- create a variable to hold the final sum
- loop through the given numbers ([link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration))
- on each iteration add the number to the sum
- return the sum after finishing the loop
